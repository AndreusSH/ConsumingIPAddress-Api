# ConsumingIPAddress-Api
I used Django to consume api.ipstack API, an API that gives you your location and other data, depending on your IP address

You can follow this link for more info: http://api.ipstack.com

Please remember that if you want to clone and try the 'App', you need to get a Key from this website
